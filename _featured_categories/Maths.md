title: Mathematics for Data Science
description: >
  I do believe that a data scientist should have strong maths foundations, so I'm trying to improve myself in this front. I find that it's a lot easier for me to grasp the maths of things if I can see and write it them in code. This page is Mathematics for Data Science: Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Calculus, with associated mini code projects to better explain the abstract concepts.
