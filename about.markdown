## Stack Half Full: <br>Not quite Full Stack, but getting there!
I'm a Data Engineer. I deal with data pipelines - data collection, data cleaning, cloud infrastructure, a bit of analytics, a bit of machine learning, optimizations, storage, etc. etc.. I consider my self a **"Stack Half-full"** data scientist (in place of the term "Half-Stack"). My skillset currently leans towards Data Engineering, but I also enjoy learning new things in the wider field of Data.

I am currently practicing writing production-ready code as much as possible. In this blog, I aim to share code and insights about the following topics:
1. Data processing (a wide field in itself)
2. Deployments and pipelines on Cloud services
3. Statistical data analysis
4. Machine Learning algorithms
5. Miscellaneous data engineering stuff, like data security and compliance

### *`Checkout` my code!*
All the code in this blog can be found in my Github profile.

#### Shameless Plug...
Oh, I also have a personal site that's completely unrelated to my life as a data engineer. While coding is my *indoor* hobby, exploring the great outdoors is my, well, *outdoor* hobby. Check it out!
