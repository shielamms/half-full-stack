## My Tech Stack is Half-Full.

Hi! I'm Shiela. I'm a *Data Engineer*, but I also love learning
the wider field of Data Science - from maths to machine learning,
as well as the analytics, algorithms, operations, and infrastructure in between.
This is my collection of articles related to data and its intricate web of subjects.

The world of tech is an ever-evolving, fast-paced environment, and often times engineers may find it overwhelming and exhausting to catch up with all its developments. There is often a lot of pressure to know everything end-to-end. **Half-Stack Full** is a reminder to not feel inadequate with one's abilities. Enjoy the learning process and be optimistic with the progression of your tech skills.
