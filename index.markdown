I'm Shiela.

I'm a Data Engineer with a lot of hobbies, but I also love the wider field of Data Science - the maths, analytics, algorithms, operations, and infrastructure in between. This is my collection of articles and projects related to data and its intricate web of subjects.

The world of data tech is fast-paced and ever-evolving, which can sometimes make data engineers feel frustrated with their current skills. I'd like to think that my tech stack is *half-full* - that I'm optimistically learning new things in my field everyday.
