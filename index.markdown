# It's half-full.

I'm Shiela.

I'm a Data & Machine Learning Engineer who loves the intricate web of Data Science topics - the maths, algorithms, operations, and infrastructure in between. I believe that data science can be so much more valuable if combined with conventional engineering practices to enable robust data-centric products. This site focuses on those engineering skills that can make a more self-sufficient data scientist, or as I'd like to call them - a **Half-Stack-Full Data Scientist**.
