I've set up a new goal for my self in the next few months: 15 weeks of reading and building mini data science projects!

Every week, I'm commiting to read about a data science topic and then code a mini-project that I will commit to a Github repository. I will then link that repository to this site and write up a summary of what that mini-project is about. Optionally I could write a whole post about it.

I refer to the broad definition of "data science", but I'll mostly be reading from books I've already bought:

1. Natural Language Processing with Python
2. Tensorflow AI for Coders
3. Linear Algebra for Machine Learning


_Why weeks? Aren't these things usually 'days'?_ I realised that I had to consider that I have a full-time job, hobbies, social commitments, and vacation plans, so I can't commit to producing something useful everyday. So to be realistic, my outputs would be on a weekly basis to allow my self more flexibility and to avoid turning this project into a stressful rather than an enjoyable experience.

## Additional rules:
- The accuracy of a model in a mini-project is of little importance. The goal of this project is to understand algorithms and concepts by coding, and not necessarily on optimising code to production level.

- The outputs must have documentation, though not necessarily complete. The purpose of a mini-project must be outlined, and all complicated algorithms or work-arounds must be explained.

## **Week 1**:
- Topic: Matrices and Matrix Operations
- Areas: linear algebra, neural networks
- Project: How to find the determinant of a matrix

---

SUM:
$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$

## **Week 2**:
- Topic: Word Embeddings
- Areas: natural language processing
- Project: Analysing Sentiments on Tweets using Word Embeddings

## **Week 3**:
- Topic: Markov Chains
- Areas: predictive models, natural language processing
- Project: Predicting Text with Markov Chains

## **Week 4**:
- Topic: N-Fold Cross-Validation
- Areas: predictive models
- Project: Building N-Fold Cross Validation Function from Scratch
