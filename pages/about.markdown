Hi! I'm Shiela. My current job title is *Data Engineer*, but I also love learning
the wider field of Data Science - from maths foundations to machine learning,
as well as the analytics, algorithms, operations, and infrastructure in between.
This is my portfolio of personal projects related to data and its intricate web of subjects.
*Stack Half-Full* is a reminder that one's knowledge in an area of study is never trully complete and that there's always something new and exciting to learn.

### Where I work
I currently work at [BridgeU](https://bridge-u.com), a data-driven ed-tech company that helps high school students around the world find universities and courses that best fit their capabilities and preferences. As a Data Engineer in a small data team, I work on data scraping and preprocessing, maintaining our data pipeline and recommender systems, and building our data infrastructure in AWS and Google Cloud.

Oh, I also have a personal site that's completely unrelated to my life as a data engineer. While coding is my *indoor* hobby, exploring the great outdoors is my, well, *outdoor* hobby. Check it out!
