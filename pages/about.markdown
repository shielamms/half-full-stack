## My Tech Stack is Half-Full.
Hi! I'm Shiela. My current job title is *Data Engineer*, but I also love learning
the wider field of Data Science - from maths foundations to neural networks,
as well as the analytics, algorithms, operations, and infrastructure in between.
This is my portfolio of personal projects related to data and its intricate web of subjects.

With this website, I want to learn and share about:
- Data Ops
  <br>This is where my current data skillset leans towards. This generally includes
  data processing on the cloud, APIs, and infrastructure.
- Natural Language Processing
  <br>I have a particular fondess for NLP rooted in my general interest in languages.
  As such, I focus more on text processing than image processing in applied machine learning.
- Maths Foundations for Data Science
  <br>I do believe that a data scientist should have strong maths foundations,
  so I'm trying to improve myself in this front.
- Machine Learning algorithms and tools
  <br>There's tons of ML theory articles out there, but I think the best way to really grasp
  how an ML algorithm/tool works is by working on projects.

#### Shameless Plug...
Oh, I also have a personal site that's completely unrelated to my life as a data engineer. While coding is my *indoor* hobby, exploring the great outdoors is my, well, *outdoor* hobby. Check it out!
