For data analysis and machine learning, I normally use **Jupyter Notebooks** and share them on Google Colab or DeepNote. Here's a bunch of Notebooks I've written while experimenting on machine learning, data wrangling, and data visualisations.
(This page is a work in progress. More notebooks to come!)

<!-- ## Data Wrangling

1. [Handling missing values in a dataset](https://deepnote.com/project/Starter-Project-yve22NpBRxG3-5U3upJbCQ/%2FAI-and-Data-Analysis%2FNeural%20Networks%20Basics%2FHandling_Missing_Values.ipynb)

2.
[Data transformation pipeline with sklearn](https://deepnote.com/project/Starter-Project-yve22NpBRxG3-5U3upJbCQ/%2FAI-and-Data-Analysis%2FNeural%20Networks%20Basics%2FPipelines.ipynb) -->


## Machine Learning
### Classification Problems
- [Classifying Cat and Dog Images with Data Augmentation and CNNs (Google Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-ENr4hvy4hiITMX493Rfar0t9LwyGGDN#scrollTo=NruGiXWOA9Wh){:target="_blank"}

    This is a simple "pet project" (pun intended) using image transformation techniques in Tensorflow to generate training data for classifying cat and dog images.

- [MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification with XGBoost on Sagemaker](https://deepnote.com/project/Starter-Project-yve22NpBRxG3-5U3upJbCQ/%2FAI-and-Data-Analysis%2FAWS%20Sagemaker%20Samples%2FMNIST%20Classification%20with%20XGBoost.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

    Of course, every Deep Learning beginner has some MNIST project to show off. This one uses Amazon Sagemaker to spin up containers for training data coming from S3.

- [MNIST Fashion Classification with Tensorflow](https://deepnote.com/project/Starter-Project-yve22NpBRxG3-5U3upJbCQ/%2FAI-and-Data-Analysis%2FTensorflow%20Experiments%2FMNIST_Classification_CNN_with_Tensorflow.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

    This one is one of the classic MNIST Fashion notebooks with a Neural Network in Tensorflow.


### Regression Problems
- [Tuning Hyperparameters of a Random Forest Regressor](https://deepnote.com/project/Starter-Project-yve22NpBRxG3-5U3upJbCQ/%2FAI-and-Data-Analysis%2FNeural%20Networks%20Basics%2FHyperparameter%20Tuning.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

    This was one of my entries for the Kaggle Housing Prices competition. I ran a Randomised Search Cross-Validation to find the optimal hyperparameters of a Random Forest Regressor on the dataset.


## Data Analysis & Visualisation
- [My FIFA 2020 Dream Team](https://deepnote.com/project/Starter-Project-yve22NpBRxG3-5U3upJbCQ/%2FAI-and-Data-Analysis%2FVisualization%2FFinding_My_FIFA_Dream_Team.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

    This was my attempt at getting myself interested in football and data visualisation at the same time, but neither of which amounted to anything significant in my life. Anyway, the dataset can be found in Kaggle for anyone interested in either.

- [Matplotlib Exercises](https://deepnote.com/project/Starter-Project-yve22NpBRxG3-5U3upJbCQ/%2FAI-and-Data-Analysis%2FVisualization%2FMatplotlib_Exercises.ipynb){:target="_blank"}

    This was a fun little lecture notebook I made for learning how to make decent graphs with Matplotlib with accompanying data analysis. The dataset is about the sales figures of a company selling beauty and hygiene products.
